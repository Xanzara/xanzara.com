###Relics (and Netherlight Crucible "Powers"):
Guideline values for various builds can be found [here](https://goo.gl/2DUi6w) in Guiltyas' relic calculator.

###Items:
Tier 19 2pc: Changed to 15% thrash damage.
Tier 19 4pc: Reduced to 8% per bleed.

Not much to say about this, 2pc still ok on AoE but will eventually fall out of use from item level.

**Convergence of fates:** is better with Incarnation builds, so you should probably resim it vs your current trinkets if you still hold on to one.

### Trinkets:
WIP.

###Rotation:
**Pooling:** is still a dps gain as it allows you to handle different situations better, but much less important to maintain uptimes. If you have a good grasp on pooling already, you can keep doing what you are doing - but don't stress out about it.

**Thrash on ST** is back, if you are using Luffa you want to maintain Thrash using CC procs just like back with T19. If you don't have Luffa, don't bother. 

**Clipping** is still around, clip any Rake less than 7 seconds remaining for a stronger one. Clip any Rip less than 80% of duration for a stronger one. Clip Thrash on AoE just as before.

**Pandemics**

Thrash: 5s without JW, 3.6 with JW.

Rip: 7.2 (With T20-4pc: 8.4) without JW. 5.76s with JW (With T20-4pc: 6.72)

Rake: 5s without JW, 3.6 with JW.v
