# Xanzaras Feral Corner

Welcome to the new version of this website. I'm sorry about it being a bit WIP, will try to develop it futher. The reason for this change is to make it faster and easier for me to maintain and update the content.

The guide is being moved over to [here](/guide/), and is currently in the process of being copied over. The old one can still be accessed [here](http://xanzara.com/xanzarasferalguide.pdf)

**If you are looking for a summary of feral after 7.3 changes, you should instead go to the [quicksheet](/quicksheet/).**

**Simulate your own character is the best way of testing various gearing choice for yourself. Easist way to do so is on [Raidbots](https://raidbots.com)**
