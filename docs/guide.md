# Xanzara's Feral Guide
## Introduction
Feral is a melee specialization, specialized at dealing sustained damage to enemies. Feral is also a specialization that features a unique playstyle, balancing limited resources and maintaining a lot of buffs and debuffs.

This guide will have two paths, with different perspective. The **beginner** path will attempt to teach a begining feral player into playing a feral druid and introduces the basics and will slowly add more advanced concepts. This will easily explain 

The [**advanced**](./guide/#advanced) path will be more akin to a reference, and it will be easy to look up any particular detail about feral gameplay you want to read about right now.

### Base Rotation
This section will explain the fundamentals of the rotation. Talents will add or change aspects of this, those changes will be presented under each talent.

Feral gameplay circle around a dynamic rotation, you rotate finishers and builders around a fairly predictable pattern.

In the builder phase, which occurs at any point we have less than 5 combo points:

A normal cycle compare of 3-4 builders, and one finisher.

#### Generators

* Rake - Maintain the Rake debuff on as many targets as fesible. This normally means 4-5 targets. Normally this means that you cast Rake if it's off the target or the remaining duration is less than the pandemic threshold (30% of base duration, or 4.5 seconds without Jagged Wounds or 3.6 seconds with Jagged Wounds). There is additional rules relating to snapshotting, those will be explained under the snapshot mechanics that affect this.

* Thrash - Maintained on 2+ targets, also serves as enabler for Swipe on larger number of targets through the Scent of Blood mechanic. There are some mechanics that will makes this enter single-target gameplay.

* Swipe - Multi-Target filler, used at 2+ targets as the lowest priority. Additionally used as a primary AoE move at larger number of enemies (5+) while Scent of Blood is up.

* Shred - Single-Target filler, used to generate combo points when no other options are available.

#### Finishers

* Rip - Maintain this finisher as much as possible. Refreshing it in Pandemic range (5.76 with Jagged Wounds, 7.2 without.) and pooling as much as possible to refresh it as late as possible. You also refresh it if it has less than half duration left and you would apply a stronger [snapshot](./guide/#snapshotting)
